As a way to brush up on Java I set out to create this program over the summer. It's inspired by the work of Darel Carey (@DarelCarey on instagram). The goal is to create a 2-D pattern of straight lines whose peaks and valleys follow a curve that makes them appear 3-D. I started by randomely generating the first 3 rows and then used the Apache Math Library's 'Polynomial Curve Fitter' in order to continue these forms down the rest of the image. The code is still rough and doesn't consistently produce good results, the main point of difficulty was handling what happens when these polynomial curves cross paths and figuring out how to merge or seperate them in a way that looked natural. However, I did produce several good results and am currently attempting to improve upon this and write it in javascript to post on my website.

Code and screenshots of different runs are posted in this folder. Enjoy!
