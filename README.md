# waveApp
This is my original attempt at writing a program in Java that will use a polynomial curve fitter from 
the apache math library in order to procedurally generate 3-D wave patterns. Inspired by the work
of @DarelCarey. Code and screenshots of some successful runs are included in this folder. Currently
attempting to write an improved version in JavaScript to post on my website. Main upgrades will 
be in collision (when two polynomial curves cross over) handling.
